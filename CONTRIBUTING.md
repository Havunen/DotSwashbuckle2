## Bug Reports ##

If you're reporting a bug, please include a clear description of the issue, the version of DotSwashbuckle.AspNetCore you're using, and a set of clear repro steps.

Please remember that DotSwashbuckle.AspNetCore is a free and open-source project provided to the community with zero financial gain to the author(s). Any issues deemed to have a negative or arrogant tone will be closed without response.

## Feature Requests ##

Fundamentally, DotSwashbuckle.AspNetCore is a library that attempts to generate an accurate description for APIs built on ASP.NET Core, using [Swagger 2.0](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/2-0/basic-structure/), according to the routes, controllers and models that have been implemented. So, the resulting API documentation is driven by "actual" behavior as opposed to "intended" behavior. This is an important distinction to consider when submitting feature requests. For example, a feature that leverages built-in attributes that affect runtime behavior (e.g. AuthorizeAttribute, RequiredAttribute etc.) would be more aligned to the project goals than one that introduces custom attributes that drive documentation and nothing else.

It's also worth noting that DotSwashbuckle.AspNetCore leverages the [swagger-ui project](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) but doesn't actually implement any UI code. If you have a bug report or feature request that's UI-specific, PLEASE DON'T CREATE AN ISSUE HERE AND POST TO THE SWAGGER-UI REPO INSTEAD.

## Pull Requests ##

If you've identified a feature/bug fix that aligns to the project goals, or even just an addition to the docs, please submit a Pull Request (PR). If applicable, include tests and ensure all tests are passing locally before you commit.
